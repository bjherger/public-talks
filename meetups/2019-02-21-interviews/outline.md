Seasonal flow
 - January: Students start looking for jobs, for start dates after graduation
 - January to March: Bonuses hit, promotions are missed, and annual reviews culminate. All of these can cause folks to 
 enter the market
 - May: Candidates with children might start to struggle balancing child care with interviewing as schools let out
 - June & November: Technical conferences usually accept sponsors and talk proposals starting in June (for October / 
 November conferences) and November (for April conferences). As with all things, a kind email or lunch meeting can 
 usually smooth over any missed deadlines.  
 - December: Getting anything scheduled during the holidays requires divine intervention
 - December: Some candidates take the holiday break to spend time preparing for and applying to new jobs
