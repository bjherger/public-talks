# Proposal Preparation

## Audience

Audience

 - Strong mix of backgrounds
 - Learning to very technical
 - Likely have an interest in ML / DL
 - Likely have seen many 'intro to DL' talks

CFP reviewers

 - Strong community leaders
 - Experience putting together Meetups and conferences
 - Hold SE position at large(-ish) companies


## Proposal Ideas

 - **Forming standards:** Every team creates their own best practices and workflows. What are common tools to create cohesive, robust Python code bases
 - **Software Engineering for Data Scientists:** Data Science projects tend to be harder to scope & more interactive. How do we create a helpful workflow for developing data science products?
 - **Deep Learning & data types:** I'm writing a library that can smartly & robustly handle common data types. We'll walk through practical ways of handling these data types, and how to make DL more approachable
 - **Agile, for Engineers:** Project management is incredibly useful to keep projects moving and teams happy. It's also a very different mindset than hands on keyboard coding. We'll work through the roles, meetings, and artifacts that comprise Agile development, and how to make agile work for you.

# Proposals

## Agile, for Engineers

### Talk Title

Agile, for Engineers

### Brief description

Project management is incredibly useful to keep projects moving and teams happy. It's also a very different mindset than hands on keyboard coding. You'll learn the roles, meetings, and artifacts that comprise Agile development, common implementations, and how to make agile work for you.

### Abstract

Large, complex projects are fulfilling, but also difficult to build. Agile development is a time-honed process for keeping projects moving, and teams happy. 

As a rare software engineer & scrum master, I've learned how to guide engineers through the agile process. Additionally, through my experience leading Machine Learning projects at a large company, I've picked up practical tips and insights that keep teammates challenged & productive.

During this talk, you'll learn the roles, meetings, and artifacts that comprise Agile development, and how to modify agile for your environment. Further, we'll learn how to communicate what you've learned to your fellow engineers, and keep everyone rollin'.

### What attendees will learn

During this talk, you'll learn the roles, meetings, and artifacts that comprise Agile development, and how to make agile work for you. Further, we'll learn how to communicate what you've learned to your fellow engineers, and keep everyone rollin'.


### Speaker and talk history

Brendan Herger has given talks at conferences including Strata, PyData, Data Intelligence Conf, Data Day Austin, the Sentiment Analysis Symposium, and others. 

### Link to slides / video

None available for this talk (yet). Draft blog post available upon request. 

### Deliver at Meetup?

## Deep Learning & Data Types

### Talk Title

Deep Learning & Data Types

### Brief description

I'm writing a library built on Keras and Pandas that can smartly & robustly handle common data types as deep learning inputs. We'll walk through why categorical, datetime, boolean, and other data types are difficult, practical ways of handling these data types, and how to make DL more approachable. 

### Abstract

Deep learning is a powerful toolset, but I've been frustrated by lack of tools and techniques to pair it with tabular data. In response, I'm building one. 

You'll learn:

 - Why non-numerical data types are difficult for most algorithms (one hot encoding, manual feature extraction, etc)
 - Practical techniques for using categorical, boolean, datetime, and geographic data (with starter code!)
 - How to quickly and efficiently prototype and iterate on deep learning models

Feedback from this talk will also help me create and prioritize features for my work-in-progress package AutoDL, which implements these methods in Pandas and Keras. 

### What attendees will learn

We'll cover how to approach use different data types in Deep Learning, and how to scope and build deep learning projects

### Speaker and talk history

Brendan Herger has given talks at conferences including Strata, PyData, Data Intelligence Conf, Data Day Austin, the Sentiment Analysis Symposium, and others. This is a new talk, covering a work in progress package.
