## Proposed title

keras-pandas: A new package to democratize Deep Learning

## Talk outline and conclusion

- Oppportunity / existing frustrations
   - DL examples commonly only include images, text and audio
   - Getting common tabular data formats into deep learning models is needlessly difficult
 - Intro to package
 - Demo
   - Example building a deep learning model in a few minutes on the Lending Club data set
 - Transformation pipeline & deep learning layers for common data types
  - Numerical, categorical, others as time allows
 - Recap & Getting started
   - What we've covered, how to get started using this package

## Intended audience

 - Data engineers and data scientists who are familiar w/ machine learning but not deep learning
 - Data scientists who are familiar w/ deep learning, and looking for tools to help them work more efficiently

## Technical skills and concepts required

 - Regression and classification

## Speaker Biography

Brendan Herger enjoys bridging the gap between data science and engineering, to build and deploy data products.

Brendan brings a unique combination of machine learning, deep learning, and software engineering skills. In his previous work at Capital One and startups,  he has built authorization fraud, insider threat, and legal discovery automation platforms. In each of these cases he's lead a team of data scientists and data engineers to enable and elevate his client's business workflow (and capture some amazing data).

When he's not knee deep in a code base, Brendan can be found traveling, sharing his collection of Japanese teas, and playing board games with his partner in Seattle.
